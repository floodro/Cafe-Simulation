# Cafe-Simulation
Hi there! This is another one of my projects that I worked on when I was studying about Data Structures and Algorithms at my local college. 

If you're wondering how I got the idea about it,  it just came to my mind that I should do a little project after going to a coffee shop near my school. 

I tried imitating how the customer serving process at a normal cafe using what I recently learned at my class.
